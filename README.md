# ft_printf | 42KL

The purpose of this project is to learn about *variadic functions* by recoding `libc`'s [`printf`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html).
Manage `diuxXcsp%` type conversions. Previous libc functions created as part of [`libft`](https://github.com/mseong123/libft/tree/master) project are also used to complete this project. 

### Allowed Functions

- [`malloc`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/free.3.html)
- [`free`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/free.3.html)
- [`write`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html)
- [`va_start, va_arg, va_end & va_copy`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stdarg.3.html)
